My Final Degree Project focused on the development of an application for the integrated management of basketball leagues and teams. The application allows to visualize and manage coaches and players, offering functionalities such as:

Registration and tracking of participating teams.
Management of coaches and their assignments to teams.
Detailed display of statistics and player profiles.
Tools to organize matches and league results.
This project combines organization, technology and my passion for basketball, providing a digital solution to improve sports management.
